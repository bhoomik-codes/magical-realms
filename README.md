## Introduction

Welcome to the enhanced RPG adventure! This text-based role-playing game allows you to create a character, battle monsters, collect items, level up, and save your progress. The game features multiple character classes, each with unique abilities, an inventory system, and a variety of monsters to defeat.

## Getting Started

When you start the game, you'll see the main title screen with options to create a new character or load an existing one. If this is your first time playing, select "Create New Character" to begin your adventure.

## Character Classes

There are three character classes to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses:

### Barbarian ü™ì
- **Base Stats**: HP 150, Mana 30, Attack 25, Defense 8
- **Special Ability**: Rage Attack - A powerful attack that deals double damage but costs 20 mana
- **Level-up Gains**: HP +15, Mana +5, Attack +3, Defense +1
- **Play Style**: The Barbarian excels at dealing high damage and has a large health pool, making them ideal for players who prefer an aggressive play style. However, they have limited mana for special abilities.

### Archer üèπ
- **Base Stats**: HP 90, Mana 60, Attack 22, Defense 12
- **Special Ability**: Precision Shot - An accurate attack with a 30% chance to ignore defense, costs 15 mana
- **Regular Attack**: More consistent damage (less randomness)
- **Level-up Gains**: HP +10, Mana +8, Attack +2, Defense +2
- **Play Style**: The Archer offers a balanced play style with consistent damage output and moderate defenses. Their special ability can be devastating against heavily armored foes.

### Mage üßô
- **Base Stats**: HP 80, Mana 120, Attack 15, Defense 5
- **Special Ability**: Fireball - A high-damage spell that costs 25 mana and partially bypasses blocking
- **Unique Ability**: Heal - Restores 25-40 HP for 30 mana
- **Level-up Gains**: HP +8, Mana +12, Attack +2, Defense +1
- **Play Style**: The Mage is a glass cannon with the highest damage potential but low survivability. They excel at using special abilities and can heal themselves, making them versatile but challenging to play.

## Game Controls

The game uses a text-based interface where you make choices by entering numbers or letters. The main game loop consists of these key menus:

### Main Menu
- Hunt Monsters üèïÔ∏è: Find and fight monsters for XP, gold, and items (you can now hunt continuously without returning to the main menu)
- Face a Villain üë∫: Battle a random villain appropriate to your level
- Challenge Boss ‚ö†Ô∏è: Face a powerful boss monster for better rewards
- Manage Inventory üéí: View, use, and equip items

- Rest and Recover üè†: Restore HP and mana to maximum
- Save Character üíæ: Save your progress
- Change Character üë•: Switch to a different character
- Exit Game üö™: Quit the game

## Combat System

Combat is turn-based and offers several actions:

1. **Attack**: Perform a basic attack
2. **Special Attack**: Use your class's special ability (costs mana)
3. **Block**: Reduce incoming damage by doubling your defense
4. **Dodge**: Attempt to avoid an attack entirely (60% success chance)
5. **Use Item**: Use a consumable item from your inventory
6. **Run**: Attempt to escape from combat (70% success chance)

### Combat Mechanics:
- **Damage Calculation**: Attack value - Defense value = Damage dealt
- **Randomness**: Attack values have some randomness (-10 to +10)
- **Blocking**: Doubles defense but prevents attacking on that turn
- **Dodging**: 60% chance to avoid attacks, but fails 70% against special attacks
- **Death**: If your HP reaches 0, you lose the battle but are revived with 50% HP and mana (losing some gold)
