RPG GAME - PC SETUP GUIDE
========================

To run this game on your PC, you'll need to set up a few things:

1. PREREQUISITES
---------------
- Python 3.10 or newer
- PostgreSQL database
- The necessary Python packages
- Game files downloaded to your PC

2. BASIC SETUP STEPS
------------------
- Install Python from python.org
- Install PostgreSQL from postgresql.org
- Create a database named "rpg_game"
- Set up the connection environment
- Run the game with our helper scripts

GUI MODE AVAILABLE!
------------------
We now provide a GUI mode that properly displays all emojis and special characters!
Use start_game_gui.bat (Windows) or start_game_gui.sh (Mac/Linux) to use it.
See GUI_MODE_GUIDE.txt for more details.

3. DATABASE CONNECTION
-------------------
You'll need these environment variables set:
- PGUSER (usually "postgres")
- PGPASSWORD (your database password)
- PGHOST (usually "localhost")
- PGPORT (usually "5432")
- PGDATABASE (your database name, e.g. "rpg_game")
- DATABASE_URL (full connection string)

4. USING THE STARTUP SCRIPTS
-------------------------
We've provided two scripts to help you start the game:

WINDOWS:
- Double-click "start_game.bat" (text mode)
- Double-click "start_game_gui.bat" (GUI mode - RECOMMENDED for Windows)
- Follow the prompts to enter your database info
- The game will start automatically

MAC/LINUX:
- Make the script executable: chmod +x start_game.sh
- Run it: ./start_game.sh (text mode)
- Or for GUI: chmod +x start_game_gui.sh && ./start_game_gui.sh
- Follow the prompts to enter your database info
- The game will start automatically

5. MANUAL STARTUP
---------------
If you prefer to set things up manually:

WINDOWS:
- Open Command Prompt
- Set environment variables (use "set VARIABLE=value")
- Run "python rpg_game.py" or "python rpg_game_gui.py"

MAC/LINUX:
- Open Terminal
- Set environment variables (use "export VARIABLE=value")
- Run "python3 rpg_game.py" or "python3 rpg_game_gui.py"

6. TROUBLESHOOTING
----------------
- Make sure PostgreSQL is running
- Check your database connection details
- Ensure Python can find the right modules
- Check that all game files are present
- For Windows: Use GUI mode if emojis don't display correctly

Enjoy your adventure!
