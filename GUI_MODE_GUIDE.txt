RPG GAME - GUI MODE GUIDE
========================

The GUI mode provides a graphical interface for the RPG game, ensuring proper display
of all graphical elements including emojis, which may not render correctly in the
standard Windows command prompt.

USING THE GUI MODE
-----------------
1. Run the appropriate starter script:
   - Windows: Double-click "start_game_gui.bat"
   - Mac/Linux: Run "./start_game_gui.sh" (make executable first with "chmod +x start_game_gui.sh")

2. The script will:
   - Check for Python and necessary components
   - Prompt you for database connection information
   - Launch the game in a graphical window

3. The GUI features:
   - A text display area for all game output
   - An input field for typing commands
   - A submit button (you can also press Enter to submit)
   - A status bar showing the current state of the game

ADVANTAGES OF GUI MODE
--------------------
- Proper rendering of all special characters and emojis
- More visually appealing interface
- Scrollable history of your gameplay session
- Works consistently across all operating systems

REQUIREMENTS
-----------
- Python 3.10 or newer
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)
- PostgreSQL database (same as the regular game mode)

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------
1. "Tkinter not available" error:
   - This means your Python installation doesn't include the Tkinter package
   - For Windows: Reinstall Python and check "tcl/tk and IDLE" during installation
   - For Mac: Use "brew install python-tk" or reinstall Python
   - For Linux: Use your package manager to install python3-tk

2. "'charmap' codec can't encode character" errors:
   - This is a common Windows issue with character encoding
   - The GUI mode should automatically handle this with its UTF-8 encoding settings
   - If you still see these errors:
     * Make sure you're using the updated start_game_gui.bat script
     * Try running the command "chcp 65001" in your command prompt before starting
     * Verify your Windows system has "Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support" 
       enabled in Control Panel > Region > Administrative > Language for non-Unicode programs

3. Display still looks wrong:
   - Try adjusting your font settings in the GUI
   - Ensure your system has fonts that support Unicode characters (like Segoe UI Emoji on Windows)
   - For Windows, consider updating to a more recent version that has better Unicode support

4. Other issues:
   - The GUI mode is just a wrapper around the text-based game
   - Any game-specific issues will still need to be resolved the same way

ENJOY THE ENHANCED EXPERIENCE!
----------------------------
The GUI mode maintains all the gameplay of the original while ensuring
you can see all the visual elements as intended.
